### Background
I was previously a graduate student at [UC San Diego](https://math.ucsd.edu/) studying Statistics.
My research interests were primarily in structured learning problems and the methodological issues they raise.

I received an A.B. in Mathematics from [Princeton University](https://www.math.princeton.edu/) where I wrote my undergraduate thesis on [Combinatorial Identification in Multi Armed Bandits](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.ngurnani.com/ngurnani_seniorthesis.pdf) under the guidance of Professor [SÃ©bastien Bubeck](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/sebubeck/).
